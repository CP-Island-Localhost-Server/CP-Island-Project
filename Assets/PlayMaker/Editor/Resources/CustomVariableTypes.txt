# Add custom types to the Variable Type Selection menu here
# 
# Syntax:
# MenuItem,Type
#
# MenuItem can include a sub-menu path, e.g.:
# MyCustomTypes\CustomType
#
# Type can include the path for Object and Enum types, e.g.:
# System.DayOfWeek
# UnityEngine.Animator
#
# So, if you use DayOfWeek a lot, you might add this:
# Favorites/DayOfWeek,System.DayOfWeek
#
# Have fun!
Favorites/DayOfWeek,System.DayOfWeek
