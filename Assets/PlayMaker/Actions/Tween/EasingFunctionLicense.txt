 * ============= Description =============
 *
 * Below is an example of how to use the easing functions in the file. There is a getting function that will return the function
 * from an enum. This is useful since the enum can be exposed in the editor and then the function queried during Start().
 * 
 * EasingFunction.Ease ease = EasingFunction.Ease.EaseInOutQuad;
 * EasingFunction.EasingFunc func = GetEasingFunction(ease;
 * 
 * float value = func(0, 10, 0.67f);
 * 
 * EasingFunction.EaseingFunc derivativeFunc = GetEasingFunctionDerivative(ease);
 * 
 * float derivativeValue = derivativeFunc(0, 10, 0.67f);
