  XML structure:
  
  Truck:
    Goal - 
      The number of bags the player must 
      unload to complete the truck. Note: 
      Not designed to exceed 60.
    MaxFlyingObjects - 
      The maximum number of objects that can 
      be in the air at a time. Can be disabled 
      by disabling the preproccessor 
      LIMIT_FLYING_OBJECT_COUNT in mg_bc_Truck.cs
    PowerupChance - 
      The chance that any spawn is a powerup. 
      Powerups have their own limits 
      (i.e. can't get a life at max life).
      If no powerup is available, a normal 
      item will be chosen.
    ThrownBagTypes - 
      Jelly mode only. The number of different 
      types of bags that will be thrown at the 
      player that they need to unload. Limited 
      to 2 (currently). Colors will be chosen 
      that are opposites on the color wheel.
    WrongBagTypes - 
      Jelly mode only. The number of different 
      types of bags that will be thrown to the 
      player that they should throw back. Will 
      always be at 90 degrees from the selected 
      colors on the color wheel.
    SpawnDelay - 
      The amount of time after the last spawn 
      that the next spawn is available to spawn. 
      Can be disabled by disabling the pre-processor 
      USE_SPAWN_DELAYS in mg_bc_Truck.cs.
    
    Objects:
      type - 
        The type of object. Currently can be bag, 
        anvil, fish, flowers. Can also technically 
        be a powerup type if you wanted to balance 
        it differently. i.e. if you didn't want to 
        use the powerup %, you could instead define 
        the powerups in the Objects section with odds 
        relative to the other objects.
      odds - 
        The relative chance of this object spawning. 
        i.e. if all the object odds add up to 100 and 
        this is set to 50, it would be 50%. Likewise, 
        if the odds add up to 150 and this is set to 
        50, it would be 33%.
        
    PowerUps:
      type - 
        The type of object. Can be extra_life or shield.
      odds - 
        The relative chance of this powerup spawning. 
        i.e. if all the powerup odds add up to 100 and 
        this is set to 50, it would be 50%. Likewise, 
        if the odds add up to 150 and this is set to 
        50, it would be 33%.
